            FANTASYBAND started in 2002 as the recording project of John Peter. After moving from his native Wisconsin Dells to New York City, Peter attended New York University to study music composition.[2] After using several different names, the young singer adopted his own name as the title of the project. Although the band has since gone through various lineup formations, the name has remained the same because John Peter writes all the music himself.[3]<br>
            In 2004, FANTASYBAND self-released his first single “Song n°1” and was soon asked to go on tour with bands like Band n°1, Band n°2, and Band n°3.[2] After hitting the road for a year, FANTASYBAND released “Song n°2” and “Song n°3” in 2006. The two singles brought the attention of independent label Fantasy Records who released the band's next single “Song n°4” in the summer of 2008. Soon after, FANTASYBAND signed with Another Fantasy Records to release their debut album.[4] “FANTASYBAND ALBUM” ranked the band as the No. 26 most anticipated album of 2009.[5]<br>                
            John Peter began work on “FANTASYBAND ALBUM N°2” in the studio with Grammy Award winning producer Peter Johnson in May 2010, recording vocals and most instrumental tracks himself, and pulling in bandmates and other instrumentalists to complete certain tracks. John Peter released “FANTASYBAND ALBUM N°2” on in the United States on March 11, 2011.[6] In anticipation for the release, the band performed "Song n°3" on the Late Show with David Letterman.[7]<br>
            FANTASYBAND performed widely in clubs and on the festival circuit in support of “FANTASYBAND ALBUM N°2”. Recent notable performances include in the fantasy Tent at the 2012 edition of the FANTASYFESTIVAL.[8] and the fantasy stage at anotherFANTASYFESTIVAL in Chicago on August 5, 2012.[9] They performed at the ANOTHER Music Festival on October 13, 2013.[10]<br>
            Their song “Song n°4” was included as a sound track of the free ride biking movie "FANTASYMOVIE" sponsored by brands such as fantasybrand Bicycle Components, anotherfantasybrand and others. Many of their other songs have been licensed to Television programs, Advertisements, and online series, etc.<br>
            Their song “Song n°2” also was included as a sound track of the soccer simulation game by FANTASYGAMES, FANTASY Soccer 2013. In 2016, their song “Song n°3” from FANTASYBAND ALBUM N°2 was prominently featured in the fourth episode of season 3 of Netflix's animated TV series fantasyserie, "fantasy episode", which was voted Time Magazine's Best episode of television in 2016.
